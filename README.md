# Taste Me: We're Here for You to Taste Music

Application made with Ionic 4 framework to present musics from [last.fm](https://www.last.fm). Enjoy!

### Quick start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darondel/taste-me.git

# Go to the project directory
cd taste-me

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
ionic serve --lab
```

In your browser, navigate to:
- [http://localhost:8100/](http://localhost:8100/) to see the desktop version.
- [http://localhost:8200/](http://localhost:8200/) to see the mobile versions.

_NOTE:_ the above setup instructions assume you have added local npm bin folders to your path.
If this is not the case you will need to install the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) globally.
